Run ./build.sh to compile.
The two test programs, client and server, are built into the Client and Server folders, respectively.

The server must be started before the client for the three-way handshake to work.

When the protocol is done, it prints "Data written to file received.jpg".
It is then up to the user to terminate the programs manually by hitting "CTRL-C".

The received files are named "received.jpg", and may be opened in an image viewer of your choice, for instance The Gimp.

Not implemented (yet):
