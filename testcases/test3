Number and name of test case
-----------------
 3 - Bit rate on bad 802.11g link

Purpose of test
---------------
To test which of the following achieves the highest average bit rate on a link with 50% signal strength:
 1) Vanilla TCP
 2) BUTP with to active queuing algorithm
 3) BUTP with different kinds of queuing algorithms

What data will we gain from this test?
--------------------------------------
 1) It will tell us which protocol yields the highest average bit rate on low-quality wireless links.

Variables to record
-------------------
 1) Time intervals to operating speed
 2) Operating speed

Equipment needed
----------------
 1) Laptop (or stationary computer) equipped with a 802.11g card
 2) Wireless 802.11g access point
 3) Server to test against

Location of test
----------------
 1) Anywhere where the equipment stated above is located.

Date of test (? if unknown)
------------
 ?
