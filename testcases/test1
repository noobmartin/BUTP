Number and name of test case
-----------------
 1 - Average bit rate on 54Mbit WLAN link with at least 80% signal strength

Purpose of test
---------------
To test which of the following achieves the highest average bit rate during a one minute test run:
 1) Vanilla TCP
 2) BUTP with no active queuing algorithm
 3) BUTP with different kinds of queuing algorithms

What data will we gain from this test?
--------------------------------------
 1) The average bit rate, which will tell us which of the protocols and additions are superior

Variables to record
-------------------
 1) Average bit rate

Equipment needed
----------------
 1) Laptop (or stationary computer) equipped with a 802.11g card
 2) Wirelesst 802.11g access point
 3) Server to test against

Location of test
----------------
 1) Anywhere where the equipment stated above is located.

Date of test (? if unknown)
------------
 ?
