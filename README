Running the code from Windows
-----------------------------
 1) Open putty
 2) Connect to rajula.org
 3) Change directory to code by:
  * cd code
 4) Change directory to Server by:
  * cd Server
 5) Start the server by specifying parameters:
  # ./server portnumber packet_loss_ratio corruption_ratio
  * ./server 2000 0 0
 6) Repeat steps 1-3
 7) Change directory to Client by:
  * cd Client
 8) Start the client by specifying parameters:
  # ./client hostname port packet_loss_ratio corruption_ratio
  * ./client rajula.org 2000 0 0

They will start the transfer immediately.

Building the code
-----------------
If changes has been made to the source code, the code can be compiled by running the following command from the code folder:
 * ./build.sh

The client and server binaries are located in the Client and Server folders, respectively.

Code structure
--------------
There are several source files in this project:
 build.sh	  - This is a compile script, it compiles all source code and places the binaries in the right folder.
 butp_functions.h - This is a header file for the protocol, and contains function definitions etc.
 butp_data.h	  - This is a header file for the protocol, and contains global variables for the protocol.
 butp.c		  - This is the main source file for the protocol.
 client.c	  - This is just a simple C program which uses the library to transfer an image.
 server.c	  - This is also just a C program which uses the library to transfer an image.
